# crime-show-anova

This is a R notebook adapted from a project I did for the course STA303. The purpose was to answer the question "if the average season rating for crime shows is the same decade to decade" using a set of randomly sampled crime shows from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s and a one way ANOVA.
